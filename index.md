ENG 6819 – Critical Making for Humanist Scholarship

# Final Reflection: Learning Through Trial, Error, and Imagination

When I first signed up for this course, I wasn’t totally sure what to expect. I figured it would have something to do with digital tools and making things. I was interested to take this class after I took a similar course with Dr. Salter. I learned that critical making isn’t about being a tech expert—it’s about being willing to experiment with different tools and understanding that errors are just part of the learning process. Taking this course completely changed the way I think about creativity, learning, and even how I see myself as a maker.


## What past perceptions did this course challenge—or confirm?


At the start of the semester, I thought that “making” meant being good at tech—like coding a perfect game. However, this course flipped that idea upside down. I learned that critical making isn’t about perfection at all. It’s about trying, failing, adjusting, and learning something new along the way. It’s ok to fail as long as we keep trying – it’s ok to not know how to do something as long as we are willing to learn.

One of the biggest things that challenged me was seeing how AI, for all its power, still carries a lot of human biases. When I tried to create images that reflected who I am—a Muslim woman—I got some really strange, sometimes almost laughable results (e.g., Female teachers with beards, outfits that didn’t match my culture). It made me realize that AI isn’t neutral, it mirrors the flaws and blind spots of the world around us. We can’t just expect AI to create exactly what we want; we have to guide it and help it get through these biases to achieve the end result that we are looking for. After all, these tools were trained by people who have certain biases and it shows – so we have to take that in to consideration when asking AI to create images and ideas for us.


## What present work are you most excited about?


Some of the projects I worked on this semester really lit a spark for me. Creating the Romeo and Juliet visual remix and the comic strip about my teaching day were two moments where everything just clicked. I realized that digital tools can actually bring stories to life in ways that feel more personal and accessible—especially for students who might struggle with traditional texts.

One moment I’ll never forget was when I reimagined Romeo and Juliet with a happier ending—just a simple image of them smiling, alive and together. It felt like rewriting a little bit of history, and it made me think about how powerful it can be to invite students to imagine different possibilities, not just accept the tragedies they’re handed. I plan on incorporating the use of these tools as part of the unit on Romeo and Juliet. I am interested to see what my students can create when asked to think outside the box about the possibilities of alternative endings to stories.

Another exercise that I am excited about and would like to continue exploring is the games that we can create through Bitsy. Even though my Bitsy game “Lost in the Big City” didn’t exactly go smoothly, I’m really proud of what I built. It wasn’t perfect, but it told a story I care about—feeling lost and eventually finding something hopeful. It reminded me that even small, simple creations can hold a lot of meaning. Creating this game allowed me to take a thought and transform it into a creative project. People can be lost in their “making” when working with these tools but once they find that spark the process gets easier from there. There have been so many times this semester when I was stuck on an exercise, but as I kept working on it, I found that “map” that allowed me to create and be proud of my creations even if they are not perfect – there is always room for growth and learning as long as we are willing to learn.


## What will you take with you to your future work?


This course gave me a whole new way of thinking about teaching and creativity. Before, I saw technology as something extra—a bonus but not essential in an educational context (my career as an educator). Now I see it as a tool for allowing students to discover and explore new ideas and thoughts. These different tools allow us to tell stories in different ways and go beyond just a simple reading and comprehending of the text – to think about what we can use the reading to create – what can we imagine and bring to life by using these tools.

One idea that’s going to stay with me is the importance of encouraging students to tinker, explore, and figure things out for themselves. That’s exactly the kind of teacher I want to be. Someone who doesn’t just deliver lessons, but creates spaces where students feel like they have permission to be creative and to make mistakes as long as they are willing to learn / grow from those mistakes. I want to encourage the usage of these different tools, because I can see that these tools can inspire students to learn so much more than just a lecture can.

I am excited to see what I can create next. I am considering taking more courses in this area to learn more about these different tools and continue thinking about ways that I can integrate them into my classroom.
